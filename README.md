## Inspiration
We realized that with so many candidates applying for jobs, interviewers don't have time to go look through every little detail on a candidate's GitHub.

## What it does
GitHubHub provides an automated solution so that recruiters have a good idea of what kind of code a candidate is capable of putting out without having to examine all of the candidate's code.

## How We built it
This project was built with node.js for the backend, and react.js for the frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
Trying to debug async issues -Surien

Understanding async functions, Learning React -Hao

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of the Pie Chart graph I created, as well as the commits graph -Hao

## What we learned
I learnt that life is fleeting -Hao
